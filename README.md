💖 Hey there, gorgeous! 💖

<!--
**TheLadyPsyco/TheLadyPsyco** is a ✨ _fabulous_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

💅 Currently slaying: Building my first Rom Hack like a designer handbag. 👜 Also, whipping up a (nearly) fully automated Plex server that's smoother than a fresh mani.💅 Oh, and adding some killer usability to the server with a Retro Pie Network share, Remote Library, Inventory System Creation, and a Stock/Portfolio analyzer that's sharper than my stilettos. 👠 And because a girl's gotta have options, I'm diving headfirst into Headless PC Optimization. 🖥️
💄 Leveling up: Mastering Python like a pro, conquering R with a flick of my wrist, and becoming fluent in SQL because data is my diamond.💎 Kubernetes and Docker? Child's play. Linux Server Environments? I rule them all. 👑
👭 Collaboration: Always down to team up with fierce femmes in tech who can keep up with my pace. If our interests align, darling, let's make some magic happen. ✨
💋 Seeking assistance: Never one to shy away from a challenge, but a little help never hurt. If you've got wisdom to share on something you see, don't be shy, dollface. And hey, if you know of any killer opportunities that would let me conquer the tech world, I'm all ears. 👂
💬 Let's chat about tech, obviously. But also makeup, fashion, gaming, breaking barriers, and, you know, casual world domination. 💅💋💣
